//! A library to parse Wikidot text and produce an abstract syntax tree (AST).
//!
//! This library aims to be a replacement of Wikidot's Text_Wiki
//! parser, which is presently a loose group of regular expressions
//! (with irregular Perl extensions). The aim is to provide an AST
//! while also maintaining the flexibility and lax parsing that
//! Wikidot permits.
//!
//! The overall flow is the following:
//!
//! * Run "messy" includer (legacy Wikidot)
//! * Run preprocessor
//! * Run tokenizer
//! * Run parser
//! * Run renderer
//!
//! Each step of the flow makes extensive use of Rust's
//! borrowing capabilities, ensuring that as few allocations
//! are performed as possible. Any strings which are unmodified
//! are passed by reference. Despite this, all of the exported
//! structures are both serializable and deserializable via
//! [`serde`].
//!
//! Rendering is performed by the trait [`Render`].
//! There are two main implementations of note,
//! [`TextRender`] and [`HtmlRender`], which render to
//! plain text and full HTML respectively.
//!
//! # Features
//! This crate has one feature of note:
//!
//! The `mathml` feature pulls in the `latex2mathml` library,
//! which renders LaTeX blocks using MathML. It is enabled
//! by default.
//!
//! # Targets
//! The library supports being compiled into WebAssembly.
//! (target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, see [`wasm-pack`] for more information)
//!
//! Compiling to wasm also disables all FFI integration,
//! since these are inherently incompatible.
//!
//! # Bugs
//! If you discover any bugs or have any feature requests,
//! you can submit them via our Atlassian helpdesk [here](https://scuttle.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2).
//!
//! Alternatively, you can [get in touch with Wikijump developers directly](https://github.com/scpwiki/wikijump#readme).
